    <p>Hello {{ cookiecutter.__requestor_salutation }},</p>
    <p>I am pleased to report that your DECS request is completed and the data are now available via OneDrive:</p>
    <ul><li><strong>Request #:</strong> DECS-{{ cookiecutter.task_number }}</li>
    <li><strong>OneDrive Link:</strong> link</li></ul>
    <p>All data from this request are governed by UCSD policies and IRB rules and regulations.</p>
    <h2 id="DECSRequestReady(SlicerDicer)-DataRetention">Data Retention</h2>
    <p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Per UCSD/ACTRI data security policies, the OneDrive file will only be available for <em>60 days&nbsp;</em> from this notice, then <em>deleted</em>.</span></strong><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"><br></span></p>
    <p>It is the sole responsibility of the PI to manage and store the study's data. The DECS team does not keep copies of released data, per UCSD data security policies.</p>
    <p>The DECS team archives released data for only 180 days before deleting—after that point a request must be re-executed. You may incur charges for any work performed.</p>
