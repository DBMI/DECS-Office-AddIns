You were supposed to have a 24 hour urine collection for Uric acid level in the urine, looks that test is not completed yet, that will tell us much uric acid is removed by the kidneys in 24 hours, that information will tell us what will be a good medication to help improve the uric acid level. Please let me know if you want to complete the above test and let me know to order that test again (the old one is cancelled) or if you want to just try Allopurinol and check the uric acid again in a few months for the efficacy.

The Dr said it does not have as many bad side effects as Colcicine.  I have been limiting the use of the colchicine as you recommended. Can you prescribe allopurinol? Thanks <patient>"

They do want positional films, which is not possible to achieve with the CT. As such, I went ahead and placed the barium enema order, and will likely need to have a discussion with Radiology once they review this, to see if we can still get this done.

I tried ordering one of these some months back and was told this has largely been replaced by CT colonography. Let me know if this testing will be acceptable to your specialist, and I can order this. Regarding Genetics, unfortunately they do not perform testing for EDS, as I have tried to get this in the past. I have also tried unsuccessfully to find providers who specialize in this, but unfortunately it is a disorder that no one really owns, and is mostly treated symptomatically depending on the area of concern with treatments such as physical therapy, pain interventions, etc.  Let me know how best I can help.

Please let me know about how I should go about ordering some of these tests that’s she is recommending. She can’t do it through UCSD but is there a chance that you can order a few of these such as the Supine and upright barium enema and/or the MRI liver with elastography?  The other thing is this genetic testing for type 4 EDS. Even though I’ve seen genetics before are you able to send a referral for me to be seen again by them so that I can discuss all of this?  Also I am happy to schedule an appointment with you if I don’t already have one to discuss everything as well. "

Thank you,  <provider>  ----- Message from <patient> to <provider> sent at 11/19/2024 12:47 PM -----  Dear <provider>, Since Friday, November 15, 2024, I have been experiencing episodes of significant weakness in my body, to the point where I feel as though I might pass out, although I do not. These episodes have been occurring several times a day, accompanied by numbness in my left arm and the left side of my mouth. Fortunately, the symptoms eventually subside. Additionally, last week I had to visit the ER due to a dull pain in my chest.  The doctor at the ER mentioned that it might be due to the stress I had been under for the last couple of days. Yesterday, I called your office, but as of today, I have not received a response from you or your nurse.  In addition, I found my interaction with <provider> at your office to be less than satisfactory,  After explaining my symptoms to her in detail, she asked me what my symptoms were!  It was obvious that she was not paying attention.  This has left me feeling disrespected and uncertain if she even sent my message to you. Given these circumstances, I would like to know if it is possible for me to switch to a different doctor, as I feel my concerns are being overlooked. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. Sincerely, <patient>"
