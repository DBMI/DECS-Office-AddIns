## Sort Follow-up Times

![image info](./toolbar.png)

This tool is used to quantify free-text comments about when a patient needs to be seen for follow-up.

In this example, the triaging physician may note the patient needs to be seen by a specific date or over a date range or using a phrase like "within 8 weeks" relative to the date on which the note was written.

The `Sort Follow-up Times` app parses these free-text comments and quantifies them into categories:

* urgent: 0-2 weeks
* moderate: 2-4 weeks
* routine: 4+ weeks
